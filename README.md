### Tired of Web UI solutions for MongoDB that just don’t cut it?

If you enjoy running **MongoDB on-premise** but feel limited by the current tools out there, **Monji** is a project you'd like.

Let’s break it down:

- **MongoExpress** is lightweight, but doesn’t natively support managing multiple clusters, lacks user management, and isn’t ideal for production environments.  
- **mongoAdmin** is no longer maintained.  
- **MongoDB Compass** is desktop-only, closed-source.
- **MongoDB Ops Manager** is enterprise-only, closed-source, and notoriously complex to set up.

### What is Monji planning to bring on the table

**Monji** aims to be a simple, lightweight, web-based admin interface that lets you:

- Manage multiple MongoDB clusters
- Handle users and permissions
- Edit your databases and documents
- All from a single, clean UI
- Easily deployable via a **single Docker image**

---

**Run the application using docker compose:**
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

**Default credentials:**<br>

Password: `admin`<br>
